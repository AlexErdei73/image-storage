# Image Storage

This is going to be my simplified version of the this project in the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-file-uploader). The project is for a Node-Express backend, where you should do this with session based authentication and the Multer middleware. I have recently got access to the [AINIRO Magic](https://docs.ainiro.io/getting-started/) backend framework cloudlet solution. This is written in C# and works with .NET framework under the hood. The interesting is that the inventor [Thomas Hansen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-hansen-ainiro/) invented his own domain specific, backend language, which he calls [Hyperlambda](https://docs.ainiro.io/hyperlambda/). This is a functional programming language, which is specifically designed to work with .NET in a fast paced manner, where most of the code is generated by the machine in the Magic IDE, which is a low-code/no-code platform. The Hyperlambda code is very simple and human readable. The platform has strong Open AI integration too.

In this project, I will use the system's authentication capabilities, which are based on [JWT](https://jwt.io/)-s. I also crete a mini storage system to store image files for registered users, whose email address is verified as well.
